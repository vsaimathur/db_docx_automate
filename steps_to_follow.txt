Idea : 
converting the docx file to zip file (common archieve) so that data can be accessed in the xml form which is available in word/document.xml in zip file. 
Now except document.xml we copy every other file in zip to a zip file, modify the document.xml file as per our needs and replace it in it's correct location.

Now for charts, the data for charts would be available in word/charts/chart1.xml. Styles for charts would be available in word/charts/style1.xml. Colors data would be available in word/charts/colors1.xml. Graphic data for charts would also be there in document.xml file too.

steps to run :
1. create a word file with name : input.docx, if specified any other any name,type the path for it in global variable (pathToFile) provided in index.js file
2. run the index.js file using node index.js after installing required packages using npm install
3. check the generated output.docx file, or any other ouput file if specified explicitly.

Also please check the charts_try_index.js which contains some implementation for charts, but for some reason it's not showing up in word document.

Some Limitations to remember : 
1. Input Document file should be given.
2. This script doesn't work on empty document file.
3. Also table would be appended in the next line after the last word/sentence/paragraph written in input docx.
